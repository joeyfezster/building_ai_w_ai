# 60s Demo Video Script

## Hook (0-5s)
"This is classic Pong, but the player is a DQN agent learning directly from pixels."

## Setup (5-15s)
Show a short clip of random play, then switch to the trained agent. Overlay: "Training: DQN smoke loop" and "Evaluation: fixed seed".

## Gameplay beats (15-45s)
- Show rally segments and agent positioning.
- Overlay metrics: episode return, episode length, steps/sec.

## Close (45-60s)
"Milestone 2 complete: reproducible DQN Pong with videos, metrics, and checkpoints. Next: longer training runs and stronger baselines."

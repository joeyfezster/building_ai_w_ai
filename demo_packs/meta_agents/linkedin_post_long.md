We kicked off the retro-RL milestone project with a dev-team agent operating model.

What it includes:
- Dedicated roles (builder, reviewer, RL scientist, demo producer)
- A mandatory `make validate` gate for every PR
- Demo packs that update at each milestone

Why it matters:
The operating model keeps the project reproducible and makes our demos shippable from day one.

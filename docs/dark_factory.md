# Dark Factory — Operating Manual

## What Is This

The dark factory is a convergence loop that turns a one-shot AI code generation into working software through automated validation and feedback. Code is never reviewed by humans — correctness is inferred from externally observable behavior.

The pattern: **Seed → Agent → Validate → Feedback → Repeat until satisfied.**

## Cross-References (DRY)

This file is the **operating manual** — the "what" and "why" of the factory. Operational detail lives in the skills:

| Concept | Source of Truth | This File |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Convergence loop steps | `.claude/skills/factory-orchestrate/SKILL.md` | Summary in ASCII diagram |
| Gate 0 two-tier composition | `factory-orchestrate/SKILL.md` Step 4 | Behavioral contract only |
| Gate 0 review paradigm docs | `.claude/skills/factory-orchestrate/review-prompts/` | References, doesn't repeat |
| PR review pack pipeline | `.claude/skills/pr-review-pack/SKILL.md` | What the human reviews |
| Code quality standards | `docs/code_quality_standards.md` | References, doesn't repeat |

When updating gate behavior or agent composition, update the **skill first**, then check this file's summary still holds.

## Architecture

**Claude Code is the factory orchestrator.** It drives the convergence loop, invokes Codex via browser, runs adversarial review, and makes holistic judgment calls. CI provides background validation on every push — it validates, it doesn't orchestrate.

### Claude Code as Orchestrator (Primary)

Claude Code runs the convergence loop via the `/factory-orchestrate` skill, using browser automation to invoke Codex through the ChatGPT Plus UI.

### CI Validation on Push (Background)

CI runs validation-only on every push to `factory/**` or `df-crank-**` branches: Gate 1 (lint/typecheck/test), Gate 2 (NFR checks), and Gate 3 (behavioral scenarios). Claude Code reads these CI results as input to its orchestration decisions. If an `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret is available, CI can also run a fallback convergence loop with Codex API — but browser orchestration is the primary path.

## Validation Gates

### Gate 0: Two-Tier Code Review (Script + Agent Team)
- **Tier 1 (deterministic):** `scripts/run_gate0.py` runs all 5 tool checks in parallel (ruff, radon, vulture, bandit, test-quality). Produces `artifacts/factory/gate0_results.json`. Fast, cheap, catches the obvious stuff.
- **Tier 2 (LLM semantic):** 4 specialized agents review the same paradigms at semantic depth, building on tier 1 output. Agents: code-health, security, test-integrity, adversarial. Paradigm prompts: `.claude/skills/factory-orchestrate/review-prompts/`
- **Fail-fast rule:** Any CRITICAL finding from either tier → stop. Do NOT proceed to Gates 1-3.
- **On Gate 0 failure:** Merge Codex's code anyway (so iteration N+1 is incremental), commit feedback, push, and loop. Never revert — Codex iterates on its own code with feedback, not from scratch.
- Clean or WARNING-only across both tiers → proceed to merge + Gate 1
- Full two-tier composition and execution: see `factory-orchestrate/SKILL.md` Step 4

### Gate 1: Deterministic CI
- `make lint` — ruff check
- `make typecheck` — mypy
- `make test` — full pytest suite (including tests the attractor wrote, already reviewed by Gate 0)

If any fail, Gates 2-3 are skipped. The agent gets the CI errors directly.

### Gate 2: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- `make nfr-check` — extensible framework (`scripts/nfr_checks.py`)
- **Active checks:** code quality (ruff extended), complexity (radon), dead code (vulture), security (bandit)
- **Planned checks:** duplication, import hygiene, coverage, maintainability, reliability
- Non-blocking — findings feed into feedback and LLM-as-judge evaluation
- Adding a new check: write a function, register in `NFR_CHECKS` dict

### Gate 3: Behavioral Scenarios
- `scripts/run_scenarios.py` executes holdout scenarios from `/scenarios/`
- Each scenario runs an evaluation command and checks pass criteria
- Results produce a satisfaction score: `passed / total`

### LLM-as-Judge (Claude Code orchestrated)
- Claude Code reasons holistically through ALL gate outputs
- Not just "score >= threshold" — considers trajectory, systemic issues, Gate 2 warnings
- Factors in: Are fixes real or is Codex gaming? Do patterns make sense?
- Holistic go/no-go decision for creating the PR

## Scenario Isolation (Branch Stripping)

The factory hides `/scenarios/` from Codex using **branch stripping** — scenarios are physically removed from the branch Codex works on.

### How it works
1. `scripts/strip_holdout.py` removes `/scenarios/` and comments out Makefile scenario targets
2. Commits with marker `[factory:holdout-stripped]`
3. Verifies no scenario files remain on the branch
4. Stripped branch is pushed to origin — Codex only ever sees this branch
5. After Codex finishes, `scripts/restore_holdout.py` restores from `origin/main`

### Why branch stripping (not filesystem shuffle)
The previous approach (`mv scenarios /tmp/`) was security theater — Codex runs in the same job and can read `/tmp/`. Branch stripping is a real gate: scenarios literally don't exist on the branch Codex sees. There's nothing to read, no path to guess, no hidden directory to discover.

### Scripts
- `scripts/strip_holdout.py` — deterministic removal, supports `--dry-run` and `--no-commit`
- `scripts/restore_holdout.py` — deterministic restoration from a git ref, supports `--ref` and `--dry-run`
- Both are factory-protected files (never modified by Codex)

## How to Trigger the Factory

### Claude Code Orchestrated (primary)
```
# Invoke the factory orchestration skill:
/factory-orchestrate
```
Claude Code handles the full loop: branch creation, holdout stripping, Codex invocation (via browser), adversarial review, validation, LLM judgment, and PR creation.

### GitHub Actions (CI validation on push)
```
# Automatic: push to factory/** or df-crank-** branches triggers CI validation
# Manual: Actions → Dark Factory → Run workflow
gh workflow run factory.yaml -f max_iterations=5 -f satisfaction_threshold=0.80
```
CI runs Gates 1-3 + feedback compilation. Claude Code reads the results.

### Local (testing the plumbing)
```bash
make factory-local    # One iteration: Gate 1 → Gate 2 → Gate 3 → feedback
make factory-status   # Show current iteration and satisfaction score
make nfr-check        # Just run Gate 2 NFR checks
```

### Individual components
```bash
make run-scenarios        # Just run scenarios
make compile-feedback     # Just compile feedback from latest results
```

## How to Write a New Scenario

Create a markdown file in `/scenarios/` with this structure:

```markdown
# Scenario: [descriptive name]

## Category
[environment | training | pipeline | dashboard | integration]

## Preconditions
- [what must be true before evaluation]

## Behavioral Expectation
[what the system should do, from observer perspective]

## Evaluation Method
\```bash
[command that tests the behavior]
\```

## Pass Criteria
[specific condition for passing]

## Evidence Required
- [what to capture as proof]
```

The evaluation method is a bash command that exits 0 on pass, non-zero on fail. Keep commands self-contained — they run in the repo root with PYTHONPATH set.

## How to Read Feedback

Feedback files are at `artifacts/factory/feedback_iter_N.md`. Each contains:
- **Summary** — satisfaction score and pass/fail counts
- **Convergence trajectory** — how scores changed across iterations
- **Likely root causes** — pattern-matched from error types
- **Full error details** — every failed scenario with complete stdout/stderr
- **Instructions** — prioritized fix guidance for the coding agent

## Accept/Merge Gate

The factory **never auto-merges** to main. When the convergence loop meets the satisfaction threshold, it creates (or updates) a PR with the `factory-converged` and `accept-merge-gate` labels. This is the single human decision point in the entire loop.

After creating the PR, the orchestrator generates a **PR review pack** via the `/pr-review-pack` skill — a self-contained interactive HTML file. The project lead reviews the report, not the code. Build specification and three-pass pipeline: see `pr-review-pack/SKILL.md`.

**What the project lead reviews (via the review pack):**
- Architecture diagram showing which zones were touched
- Adversarial findings from the Gate 0 agent team, graded by file
- CI performance with health classification
- Key decisions with zone-level traceability
- Convergence result — gate-by-gate status and satisfaction score
- Post-merge items with code snippets and failure/success scenarios
- Factory history — iteration timeline, intervention log, gate findings per iteration

**To accept:** Approve and merge the PR. The factory branch can be deleted.
**To reject:** Close the PR and either adjust scenarios/specs or trigger another factory run.

The accept/merge gate exists because code produced by the factory was never reviewed by humans during production. The review pack provides structured visibility into what the factory did and why. The merge decision is always human.

## When to Escalate

Escalate to interactive debugging (Claude Code) when:
- The factory has stalled for 3+ iterations with no score improvement
- The same scenario keeps failing with the same error pattern
- Gate 1 failures persist (the code doesn't even pass lint/typecheck)
- A scenario requires architectural changes the agent can't figure out from error messages alone

## Factory State

```
artifacts/factory/
├── gate0_results.json       # Gate 0 tier 1 tool check results (gitignored)
├── scenario_results.json    # Latest run results (gitignored)
├── ci_output.log            # Latest CI output (gitignored)
├── iteration_count.txt      # Current iteration number (committed)
└── feedback_iter_*.md       # All feedback files (committed — Codex reads these)
```

## Known Evolution Paths

Architecture decisions that are correct for the current proof-of-concept but should be revisited as the factory matures:

| Decision | Current State | Evolution Trigger | Target |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Separate factory-loop + validate CI workflows | Overlap provides redundancy | Factory running regularly with stable gates | Consolidate into single workflow with clear separation |
| `.devcontainer` setup | Not yet configured | Multiple developers or CI environments diverging | Add devcontainer with pinned Python, deps, hooks |
| Gate 2 NFR framework is code-review only | Static analysis checks (ruff, radon, vulture, bandit) | System deployed to infrastructure environments | Add infrastructure-level NFR checks: elasticity, scaling, deployment health |
| Post-merge items tracked in review pack only | PR review pack captures items | Items getting lost after merge | `scripts/create_postmerge_issues.py` creates GH issues automatically |
| Manual `make install-hooks` required | Prominent in docs, not enforced | New contributors missing it | `.devcontainer` or CI check that validates hooks are installed |
